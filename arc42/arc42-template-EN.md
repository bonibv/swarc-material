# Architecture Constraints

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

* Security concerns: Security is a paramount concern, especially in microservices and mobile development. Architects must adhere to security constraints such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and protection against common security vulnerabilities when designing API Gateway patterns. These constraints limit design freedom to prioritize security.
* Interoperability constraints: Cross-platform mobile development often involves multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web). Architects need to ensure that the API Gateway provides consistent and compatible interfaces for different client platforms. This can limit the choice of technologies and APIs used in the development process to ensure seamless interoperability.
* Versioning and Compatibility Constraints: As systems evolve, architects need to maintain backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing clients. This constraint may limit the freedom to make drastic changes in the API or microservices without providing appropriate versioning and migration strategies
* Regulatory and Compliance Constraints: Many industries have specific regulations and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR). Architects must consider these constraints when designing API Gateway patterns for microservices. Compliance with these rules may necessitate data handling, auditing, and reporting features that could impact architectural choices.

# Cross-cutting Concepts

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas
that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. They can
include many different topics, such as

-   models, especially domain models

-   architecture or design patterns

-   rules for using specific technology

-   principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (=
    cross-cutting) nature

-   implementation rules

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Concepts form the basis for *conceptual integrity* (consistency,
homogeneity) of the architecture. Thus, they are an important
contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks,
e.g. security or safety.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

The form can be varied:

-   concept papers with any kind of structure

-   cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the
    architecture views

-   sample implementations, especially for technical concepts

-   reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using
    Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Structure**

</div>

A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

-   Domain concepts

-   User Experience concepts (UX)

-   Safety and security concepts

-   Architecture and design patterns

-   "Under-the-hood"

-   development concepts

-   operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one
specific topic on this list.

![Possible topics for crosscutting
concepts](images/08-Crosscutting-Concepts-Structure-EN.png)

See [Concepts](https://docs.arc42.org/section-8/) in the arc42
documentation.

## *\<Domain Concepts>*

*\<The domain model of PictShare encapsulates user-generated content, profile management, and interaction. It defines how users interact with the system, including uploading, editing, and sharing images, as well as following and engaging with other users.>*

## *\<User Experience (UX) Concepts>*

*\<PictShare emphasizes a user-centered design approach, focusing on intuitive navigation, responsive interfaces, and accessible editing tools. This ensures a frictionless experience from image upload to final share.>*

## *\<Security Concepts>*
*\<Security is a top priority, with measures such as two-factor authentication, secure image storage, and privacy controls for user profiles and content. Data encryption safeguards against unauthorized access.>*

## *\<Architecture Patterns>*
*\<PictShare may adopt a microservices architecture, where services are loosely coupled, independently deployable, and organized around business capabilities, enhancing the system's flexibility and scalability.>*

## *\<Operational Concepts*
*\<Cloud-based deployment ensures PictShare is scalable and reliable, with continuous monitoring, automated scaling, and disaster recovery processes in place to maintain service availability and performance.>*

## *\<Development Concepts>*
*\<Development follows best practices such as Agile methodologies, test-driven development, and continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines, enhancing code quality and facilitating rapid iterations.>*

# Architecture Decisions

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

"_Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions
including rationales. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative
based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision
should be documented here in this central section or whether you better
document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building
block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the
most important decisions of your architecture._"

PictShare's architecture decisions include adopting a microservices architecture for scalability, using cloud-based storage for reliability, and implementing robust security measures for user data protection.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

"_Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace
your decisions._"

These decisions are driven by the need to manage a large user base, ensure high availability of the service, and maintain trust through secure operations.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

Various options:

-   ADR ([Documenting Architecture
    Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions))
    for every important decision

-   List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:

-   more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

See [Architecture Decisions](https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/) in the
arc42 documentation. There you will find links and examples about ADR.

| Problem | Considered Alternatives | Decision |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Microservices are too expensive | Use a monolith architecture | Hire more DevOps specialists|
| API Gateway Performance Bottlenecks | Implement load balancing and caching mechanisms within the API Gateway to reduce performance bottlenecks | Implement load balancing and caching mechanisms within the API Gateway to improve performance and alleviate bottlenecks |
| Cross-Platform UI Performance Issues | Optimize the application code and UI components for each platform independently to achieve native-like performance, but still retain cross-platform code base | Optimize the application code and UI components for each platform independently to ensure that the cross-platform app delivers a smooth and responsive user experience |


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Quality Requirements

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with
scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in
section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important
to them, concrete and measurable.

See [Quality Requirements](https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/) in the
arc42 documentation.

## Quality Tree

<div class="formalpara-title">

![SWARC 5 Quality Tree](https://github.com/bonibv/swarc-material/assets/132003411/7e2b3b4a-30ba-4e9f-b4d9-422aab12c036)


**Content**

</div>

The quality tree (as defined in ATAM â Architecture Tradeoff Analysis
Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes
large number of quality requirements.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and
requirements:

-   tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or
    "usefulness" as a root

-   a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the
following section.

## Quality Scenarios

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>
" _
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements
using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at
the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

-   Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case
    scenarios) describe the systemâs runtime reaction to a certain
    stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the systemâs
    efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a userâs
    request within one second.

-   Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its
    immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is
    implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change._ "


* App Stability
Scenario: The app should not crash more than twice a month, ensuring a consistent user experience. Simple monitoring will be set up to alert the team to issues.

* User-Friendly Performance
Scenario: The app should handle up to 10,000 users at a time without slowing down, with image uploads taking no more than 5 seconds, ensuring a smooth experience even during peak times.

* Community Engagement
Scenario: Users should return to the app weekly, with features like challenges designed to be easy and fun, encouraging regular engagement and helping to maintain a steady user community.



<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily
measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2) more
precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and
evaluated.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

Tabular or free form text.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Risks and Technical Debts

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

"_A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by
priority
_"

1. User Experience Impact
Cross-platform development offers cost-efficiency but accumulates technical debt for native features. Ongoing maintenance is essential for competitiveness.

2. Performance and Reliability
User Experience Impact
Cross-platform development offers cost-efficiency but accumulates technical debt for native features. Ongoing maintenance is essential for competitiveness.

3. Performance and Reliability
Centralized API Gateway in microservices introduces risks, technical debt, and performance impacts. Optimization is essential to maintain stability.
Security Vulnerabilities
Cross-platform mobile development accumulates security-related technical debt, requiring ongoing security efforts to manage platform-specific vulnerabilities and ensure resilience to emerging threats, safeguarding user data against breaches and compromises.


<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

âRisk management is project management for grown-upsâ (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested
measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

See [Risks and Technical Debt](https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/) in
the arc42 documentation.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Glossary

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use
when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in
multi-language teams.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

-   have an identical understanding of these terms

-   do not use synonyms and homonyms

A table with columns \<Term> and \<Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

See [Glossary](https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/) in the arc42
documentation.
